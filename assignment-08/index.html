    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <p>I got guns in my head and they won't go
      Spirits in my head and they won't go
      I got guns in my head and they won't go
      Spirits in my head and they won't
    </p>
    <p>I been looking at the stars tonight
      And I think oh, how I miss that bright sun
      I'll be a dreamer 'til the day I die
      But they say oh, how the good die young
      But we're all strange
      And maybe we don't wanna change
    </p>

    <p>I got guns in my head and they won't go
      Spirits in my head and they won't go
      I got guns in my head and they won't go
      Spirits in my head and they won't go
      But the gun still rattles
      The gun still rattles, oh
      I got guns in my head and they won't go
      Spirits in my head and they won't go
    </p>

    <p>I spent a lot of nights on the run
      And I think oh, like I'm lost and can't be found
      I'm just waiting for my day to come
      And I think oh, I don't wanna let you down
      'Cause something inside has changed
      And maybe we don't wanna stay the same
    </p>
    <p>
      I got guns in my head and they won't go
      Spirits in my head and they won't go
      I got guns in my head and they won't go
      Spirits in my head and they won't go
      But the gun still rattles
      The gun still rattles, oh
      But the gun still rattles
      The gun still rattles, oh
    </p>
    <p>
      And I don't want a never ending life
      I just want to be alive while I'm here
      And I don't want a never ending life
      I just want to be alive while I'm here
      And I don't want to see another night
      Lost inside a lonely life while I'm here
    </p>
    <p>
      I got guns in my head and they won't go
      Spirits in my head and they won't go
      I got guns in my head and they won't go
      Spirits in my head and they won't go
      But the gun still rattles
      The gun still rattles, oh
      But the gun still rattles
      The gun still rattles, oh
    </p>
